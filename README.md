# GE529

Scripts to parially or fully get the labs required for the class. So far we 
have:

- NPP Lab: Ported from matlab
- drought lab: Preprocessing done in bash with gdal, and the rest of the code 
  adapted from original matlab scripts (Provided by Jian Bi). The goal is to recreate them in python
  some time.
